# API Development using FastAPI framework

API development using Python, FastAPI, and other cool tools like Postgres (PGAdmin) and Postman. Used an ORM instead of raw SQL in my code. Includes basic back-end functionality of a social-media type website. Posting, deleting posts, editing and signing up new users, as well as voting on posts are some of the available functions.
